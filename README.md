# TrOCR_for_text_localization-free_OCR_of_IAM_handwritten_dataset

## Summary
The notebook presents a handwritten text localization-free OCR approach on IAM handwritten full page dataset employing TrOCR model. TrOCR is multimodal transformer architecture, including vision transformer for extracting visual features and text transformer for language modeling. The curriculum learning method will be used for fine-tuning. The mode will be incrementally trained on larger text sequences until it generalizes a page of free text.
